[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/dhinesh6381/Virtual_Mouse)](LICENSE.md)

This Python application enables control of the mouse cursor through hand gestures captured via webcam. It leverages Mediapipe for hand tracking and OpenCV for video processing, allowing users to perform actions like moving the cursor, left-clicking, right-clicking, dragging, and scrolling using intuitive gestures.

## Features
- **Hand Tracking**: Utilizes Mediapipe to detect and track landmarks of the user's hand in real-time.
- **Cursor Control**: Moves the mouse cursor based on the position of the index finger.
- **Gesture Actions**: Supports gestures for left-clicking, right-clicking, dragging, and scrolling using specific hand configurations.
- **User Instructions**: Provides on-screen instructions for gesture controls and actions.
